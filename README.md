# DashboardTester
DashboardTester is an Rselenium script for simulating users on the ChatDashboard webapps. It can use self-exported and simulated chat logs for testing purposes and is written for the structure of the [default configuration of ChatDashboard](https://shiny.molekulare-psychologie.de/jkohne/ChatDashboardShowcase/?id=ShowCaseUser). Should you want to test an instance of ChatDashboard that you adapted, you might need to adapt DashboardTester accordingly. The scripts simulates research participants uploading, subsetting, and donating data, and enables to test if a) all PII is reliably removed from donated datasets b) all data not manually selected for data donation is not contained in the donations.
